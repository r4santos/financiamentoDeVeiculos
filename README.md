<h2 id=objective>📝 Objective</h2>
Develop a Flutter application that simulates the display of vehicles for financing, using concepts of inheritance, abstract classes and composition of custom widgets. The application should allow the user to view different vehicles, their data and calculate a financing simulation.

<h2 id=Description>📖 Description</h2>

The app must contain a list of vehicles available for financing. When clicking on each vehicle, the app must navigate to a details screen with its characteristics (make, model, year, color, price, etc.) and a simple financing simulation calculator, where the user enters the down payment amount and the term to view the estimated value of the installments.
